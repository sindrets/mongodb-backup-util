Usage: mbu [OPTIONS...] [PATH]
mbu (mongodb-backup-util) is a utility that enables easy backup and restoration
of any MongoDB database.

Examples: 

  mbu -la                                  # Lists all available backups
  mbu -b                                   # Creates a new backup
  mbu -b --db="fooBar" --path="~/backups"  # Creates a new backup of db "fooBar"
                                           # in the directory "~/backups".
  mbu -r ~/backups/fooBar-190401-091200    # Restores the db from the specified
                                           # backup. 

Operations:

  -b, --backup                Creates a new backup.
  -r, --restore               Restores a database from a specified backup.
  -l, --list                  Lists all available backups.
  -s, --schedule[=CRON-EXP]   Performs a backup on an interval specified by a
                              cron expression.
      --db=DB-NAME            Selects the specified database.
      --path=PATH             Sets the target directory. During backup, this is
                              the folder in which backups are created. During
                              restore, this is the backup directory. During
                              list, this is the directory that will be scanned
                              for available backups.

Schedule options:

      --name=NAME             Sets the name of the schedule job.

List options:

  -a                          List all available backups.
      --limit=INT             Set the max number of backups to display.
